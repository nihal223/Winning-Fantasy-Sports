Analyzing Fantasy sports (Basketball) using spark

Determining the value of a player in fantasy
sports is essential and it is not a trivial task. The ultimate goal of this project is to produce a ranked list of players in terms of their value, but being able to assign a numerical value in order to compare players directly would also be useful for many use cases. Many sports fans turn into statisticians to get an edge in their fantasy sports leagues. Depending on one’s technical skills, this “edge” is usually no more sophisticated than simple spreadsheet analysis, but some particularly intense people go to the extent of creating their own player rankings and projection systems. This project is interesting because it incorporates the use of technology to determine the right players to choose in fantasy leagues in order to win.
